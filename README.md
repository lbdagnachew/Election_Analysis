Challenge Summary 

For this analysis, I'll be assisting a Colorado board of Election employee Tom in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S. 
Congressional precinct in CO. I'll be Writing scripts in Python to determine the
total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, percentage of votes 
for each candidates, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
Using this code can be used on similar projects such as other congressional district elections,
 senatorial districts, local elections, and more.
